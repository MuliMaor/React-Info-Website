My first dabble with React on my self-learning journey.

This simple web app features

* Sub-title that upon page refresh will describe the React concepts as either crucial, fundamental, or core concepts.
* Bite-sized explanations of these 4 core react concepts; Components, JSX, Props, and States.
* Clickable tabs with code examples for each of these concepts.
  
All 4 of these React essentials are used in the coding of this project, and care was taken to use efficient, optimized code and coding best practices.
